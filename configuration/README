The content of this directory is used to initialize the SFTPPlus configuration.

Replace server.ini with a custom one to add your own users and your own
SSL certificates and SSH keys to the SFTPPlus container.

You can add SSL certificates and SSH keys in separate files as well and then
reference them in your custom configuration.
